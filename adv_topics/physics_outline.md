# Physics Advanced Topic Presentations

## Presentation I (Oct. 19):
Physics

Physics exists in games too!
	Try to simulate given hardware/real-time constraints

Games with physics!
	Minecraft
	Super Meat Boy
	Goat Simulator

What is physics?
	Vectors(Acceleration, velocity, displacement relationship)
	Forces/Mass
	Normal Force
	Friction
	Collisions(Momentum)
	
Identifying physics within games
	Minecraft
	Super Meat Boy
	Goat Simulator

Applying Physics to our game
	Describing our game, emphasizing physics

	


## Presentation II (Nov. 4):

 Aproximation

   Some things are far too complex to simulate in real time
  
    Destruction
   
     Realistic - Blender Simulation
    
     Game
    
      Minecraft - tnt
     
      Noita
     
    Fluid Dynamics
   
     Realistic - Another Blender Simulation
    
     Game
    
      Not generally close to realistic looking
     
      Minecraft - water
     
      GTA V - waves
     
      Mario - water level
     
  Some things don't have to be simulated at all times
 
   Gravity when standing still
  

 Friction and Drag

  On ground
 
  In Water
 
  In air
 
  
Air Control

  Different systems
 
   Realistic - No air control
  
   2D
  
    Mario
   
    Asteroid
   
    Metroid
   
   3D
  
    Borderlands
   
    TF2
